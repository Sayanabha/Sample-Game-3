  <h1>Game Readme</h1>
  <p>This repository contains a game developed using Unity3D and programmed in C#. The game involves spawning animals at timed intervals and implementing collision detection to destroy objects and trigger a "Game Over" message.</p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Spawn Animals</h3>
      <p>In the Unity project, locate the script responsible for spawning animals. Create a new method within the script to handle the spawning functionality. This method should include the necessary logic to instantiate animal objects at desired positions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Timed Intervals</h3>
      <p>Implement the functionality to spawn animals at timed intervals. You can use Unity's built-in timer or a custom timer implementation to control the spawning frequency. Adjust the timing as per your game's requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Collider and Trigger Components</h3>
      <p>To enable collision detection, add collider and trigger components to the game objects involved in the collision. Colliders define the shape and size of the object, while triggers allow detecting when another object enters or exits the collider's bounds.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Destroy Objects on Collision</h3>
      <p>Implement the logic to destroy objects when they collide with other specific objects. Utilize the collision detection mechanism provided by Unity and handle the collision event within your script. Destroy the objects involved in the collision to create the desired effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: "Game Over" Message</h3>
      <p>When a specific condition is met, trigger a "Game Over" message to inform the player that the game has ended. Determine the condition that signifies the end of the game and display an appropriate message using Unity's user interface system or other desired means.</p>
</li>
